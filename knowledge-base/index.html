<h4>Fundamentals</h4>

<h5>Q: What is Python? Name some characteristics of Python?</h5>
<ol>
<li>Python (CPython) is an interpreted language (like PHP, Ruby). That means that, unlike languages like C and its
   variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run (well, some compilation happens)</li>
<li>Ease of use and ease of refactoring, thanks to the flexibility of Python’s syntax, which makes it especially useful
   for rapid prototyping.</li>
<li>Python is dynamically-typed and strongly-typed:<ul>
<li>flexibility - means that you don't need to state the types of variables when you declare them. <code>x = 111</code> and
  then <code>x=" I'm a string"</code> without error;</li>
<li>avoiding pesky implicit-type-conversion - you can't perform operations inappropriate to the type of the object.
  e.g. <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'x' + 3</code> will raise <code>TypeError</code>
  . <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/5/duck-typing-python">more details...</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More compact code, thanks again to Python’s syntax, along with a wealth of functionally-rich Python libraries (
   distributed freely with most Python language implementations).
   Python is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with
   composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++'s public, private), the justification
   for this point is given as "we are all adults here". In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that
   they can be assigned to variables, returned from other
   functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first-class objects</li>
<li>Python does not support pointers</li>
<li>Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately, Python allows the
   inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimised away and often are. The <code>numpy</code> package is a good
   example of this, it's really quite quick because a lot of the number crunching it does isn't actually done by Python</li>
<li>Python finds use in many spheres - web applications, automation, scientific modeling, big data applications and many
   more. It's also often used as "glue" code to get other languages and components to play nice. It’s free and open
   source! Need we say more?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Q:  What are some drawbacks of the Python language?</h5>
<p>The two most common valid answers to this question (by no means intended as an exhaustive list) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)</strong>. CPython (the most common Python implementation) is not fully thread safe. In order
   to support multithreading Python programs, CPython provides a global lock that must be held by the current thread
   before it can safely access Python objects. As a result, no matter how many threads or processors are present, only
   one thread is ever being executed at any given time. In comparison, it is worth noting that the PyPy implementation
   provides a stackless mode that supports micro-threads for massive concurrency.</li>
<li>
<strong>Execution speed</strong>. Python can be slower than compiled languages since it is interpreted.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Q: Is Python interpreted or compiled?</h5>
<p>As noted in <em><a href="https://www.toptal.com/python/why-are-there-so-many-pythons">Why Are There So Many Pythons?</a></em>, this is,
frankly, a bit of a trick question in that it is malformed.
Python itself is nothing more than an interface definition (as is true with any language specification) of which there
are multiple implementations. Accordingly, whether “Python” is interpreted or compiled does not apply
to the Python language itself; rather, it applies to each specific implementation of the Python specification.</p>
<p>Further complicating the answer to this question is the fact that, in the case of CPython, the answer really is “sort
of both”. Specifically, with CPython, code is first ‘compiled’ and then interpreted. More precisely, it is not
precompiled to native machine code, but rather to <em>bytecode</em>. While machine code is certainly faster, bytecode is more
<em>portable</em> and <em>secure</em>. The bytecode is then interpreted in the case of CPython (or both interpreted and compiled to
optimized machine code at runtime in the case of <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>).</p>
<h5>Q: What does “Python is an interpreted language” mean?</h5>
<p>In Python, the source is compiled into a much simpler form called <em>bytecode</em>. These are instructions similar in spirit
to CPU instructions. But instead of being executed by the CPU of the target OS, they are executed by a Python Virtual
Machine (PVM)/interpreter. The built-in <code>dis</code> module is the disassembler that can show you bytecode (<em>*.pyc</em> files).
The PVM executes Python programs that have been compiled from the Python language into a bytecode representation. The
PVM assumes that any bytecode being executed is "well-formed" with regard to a number of implicit constraints.

<p><img alt="Compiler_vs_Interpreter_comparison" src="../images/knowledge-base/Compiler_vs_Interpreter_comparison.png"></p>
<h5>Q: What are some alternative implementations to CPython? When and why might you use them?</h5>
<p>One of the more prominent alternative implementations is <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>, a Python implementation
written in Java that utilizes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While CPython produces bytecode to run on the CPython VM,
Jython produces Java bytecode to run on the JVM.</p>
<p>Another is <a href="http://ironpython.net/">IronPython</a>, written in C# and targeting the .NET stack. IronPython runs on
Microsoft’s Common Language Runtime (CLR).</p>
<p>As also pointed out in <a href="https://www.toptal.com/python/why-are-there-so-many-pythons">Why Are There So Many Pythons?</a>, it
is entirely possible to survive without ever touching a non-CPython implementation of Python, but there are advantages
to be had from switching, most of which are dependent on your technology stack.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy alternative implementation is <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> whose key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed. Thanks to its Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, Python programs often run faster on PyPy.</li>
<li>Memory usage. Large, memory-hungry Python programs might end up taking less space with PyPy than they do in CPython.</li>
<li>Compatibility. PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code. It supports cffi and can run popular Python
  libraries like Twisted and Django.</li>
<li>Sandbox. PyPy provides the ability to run untrusted code in a fully secure way.</li>
<li>Stackless mode. PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode, providing micro-threads for massive
  concurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: How memory is managed in Python?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Python memory is managed by Python <strong>private heap space</strong>. All Python objects and data structures are located in a
  private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap and the interpreter takes care of this Python
  private heap.</li>
<li>The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by the <em>memory manager</em>. The core API gives access to
  some tools for the programmer to code.</li>
<li>Python also has an inbuilt <em>garbage collector</em>, which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it
  available to the heap space.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: How does the garbage collector (GC) work in Python? Describe Python's garbage collection mechanism in brief</h5>
<ul>
<li>Python maintains a count of the number of references to each object in memory. If a reference count goes to zero then
  the associated object is no longer live and the memory allocated to that object can be freed up for something else</li>
<li>occasionally things called "reference cycles" happen. The GC periodically looks for these and cleans them up. An
  example would be if you have two objects o1 and o2 such that o1.x == o2 and o2.x == o1. If o1 and o2 are not
  referenced by anything else then they shouldn't be live. But each of them has a reference count of 1.</li>
<li>Certain heuristics are used to speed up garbage collection. For example, recently created objects are more likely to
  be dead. As objects are created, the GC assigns them to generations. Each object gets one generation, and younger
  generations are dealt with first.
  <strong>This explanation is CPython specific.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What are the built-in data types that Python provides? Which of them are immutable/mutable?</h5>
<p><em>Immutable</em> built-in datatypes/structures</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>bytes</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>tuple</code>, <code>frozenset</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mutable</em> built-in datatypes/structures</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>, <code>set</code>, <code>bytearray</code>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What is PEP8?</h5>
<p>Style Guide for Python Code. It is the latest Python coding standard, a set of coding recommendations, coding
conventions. (Python Enhancement Proposal) One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is
written. The guidelines provided are
intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20
says, "Readability counts".
A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more
significant. Consistency within one module or function is the most
significant. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">python.org</a></p>
<h5>Q: How do I modify a string in Python?</h5>
<p>You can’t, because strings are immutable. In most situations, you should simply construct a new string from the
various parts you want to assemble it from.</p>
<h5>Q: Does Python have an <code>array</code> data type? What is the difference between arrays and lists?</h5>
<p><code>array</code> module defines an object type which can compactly represent an array of basic values: characters, integers,
floating point numbers. Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of objects
stored in them is constrained (homogeneous). The type is specified at object creation time by using a type code, which
is a single character. Array objects also implement the <em>buffer interface</em>, and may be used wherever bytes-like objects
are supported. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html">official docs</a></p>

</pre>
<h5>Q: What is <code>pass</code> in Python?</h5>
<p>Pass means, no-operation Python statement, or in other words it is a placeholder in compound statement, where there
should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there.
Python has the syntactical requirement that code blocks cannot be empty. Empty code blocks are however useful in a
variety of different contexts, for example if you are designing a new class with some methods that you don't want to
implement:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">MyClass</span>(<span class="n">object</span>):  <span class="c1"># (object) is for Python 2.*</span>
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">method_a</span>(<span class="nb">self</span>):
        <span class="nb">pass</span>

    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">method_b</span>(<span class="nb">self</span>):
        <span class="nb">print</span>(<span class="s">"I'm method_b"</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to leave out the <code>pass</code>, the code wouldn't run, and you'll get an error:
IndentationError: expected an indented block</p>
<p>Other examples when we could use <code>pass</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring (all or) a certain type of <code>Exception</code>
</li>
<li>Deriving an exception class that does not add new behavior</li>
<li>Testing that code runs properly for a few test values, without caring about the results</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: Given variables a and b, switch/swap their values so that b has the value of a, and a has the value of b without using an intermediary variable.</h5>
<p>a, b = 5, 10 # tuple unpacking
a, b = b, a</p>
<h5>Q: What is <code>*args</code>, <code>**kwargs</code> in function definition? And why would we use it?</h5>
<p>Use <em>args when we aren't sure how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if we want to pass a stored
list or tuple of arguments to a function. </em><em>kwargs is used when we don't know how many keyword arguments will be
passed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The identifiers args
and kwargs are a convention, you could also use </em>bob and **billy but that would not be wise.</p>

<h5>Q: What is docstring in Python?</h5>
<p>Python docstrings are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or
module. We can access these docstrings using the <strong>doc</strong> attribute. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">PEP 257</a></p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">def</span> <span class="nv">square</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">n</span><span class="ss">)</span>:

<h5>Q:  How can you copy an object in Python?</h5>
<p>Use copy.copy () or copy.deepcopy() for the general case. You cannot copy all objects but most of them.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>x = copy.copy(y)     # make a shallow copy of y
x = copy.deepcopy(y) # make a deep copy of y; module specific errors &gt;copy.Error
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other
objects, like lists or class instances).</p>
<ul>
<li>A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts <em>the same objects</em> into it
  that the original contains.</li>
<li>A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts <em>copies</em> into it of the objects found in
  the original.</li>
</ul>
<p>Python's deep copy operation avoids problems (recursive objects, too much data for copy, e.g. administrative data
structures) by:</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping a table of objects already copied during the current copying pass</li>
<li>letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the set of components copied</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q:  When to use a <code>tuple</code> vs <code>list</code> vs <code>dictionary</code> in Python?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use a <code>tuple</code> (immutable) to store a sequence of items that will not change. Tuples are faster than lists; can be
  hashed
  for, e.g. as a key for dictionaries.</li>
<li>Use a <code>list</code> (mutable) to store a sequence of items that may change. Lists are slower than tuples.</li>
<li>Use a <code>dict</code> when you want to associate pairs of two items.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What keywords can be used in conjunction with the <code>for</code> keyword?</h5>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">not</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">break</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">continue</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">pass</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>else</code> keyword after <code>for</code> loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished normally.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>break</code></dt>
<dd>Allows loop termination when some condition is met and the control is transferred to the next statement.</dd>
<dt><code>continue</code></dt>
<dd>Allows skipping some part of a loop when some specific condition is met and the control is transferred to the
beginning of the loop</dd>
<dt><code>pass</code></dt>
<dd>Used when you need some block of code syntactically, but you want to skip its execution. Nothing happens when this is
executed.</dd>
</dl>
<h5>Q: What could be the <code>dict</code> key?</h5>
<p>First, a <em>dictionary key must be of a type that is hashable ~ immutable</em>. For example, you can use an <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
<code>str</code>, or <code>bool</code> as a dictionary key. However, neither a <code>list</code> nor another <code>dict</code> can serve as a key, because lists and
dictionaries are mutable (<code>TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'</code>). Values, on the other hand, can be any
type and can be used more than once.</p>
<p>Second, a given key can appear in a dictionary only once (must be unique). Duplicate keys are not allowed. A
dictionary maps each key (using hash()) to a corresponding value (creates hashtable), so it doesn’t make sense to map
a particular key more than once. If you specify a key a second time during the initial creation of a dictionary, then
the second occurrence will override the first. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-dicts/">more details...</a></p>
<h5>Q: What's the difference between <code>globals()</code>, <code>locals()</code>, and <code>vars()</code>?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<code>globals()</code> <em>always</em> returns the dictionary of the module namespace</li>
<li>
<code>locals()</code> always returns a dictionary of the <em>current</em> namespace (e.g. funcs)</li>
<li>
<code>vars([obj])</code> returns <em>either</em> a dictionary of the current namespace(symbol table) (if called with no argument) or the
  <em>dictionary of the arguments</em> of any module / class / instance of a class, etc. If the object does not have _<em>dict_</em>
  , it
  will raise a <code>TypeError</code> exception (e.g. print(vars(12)) ). We can also use it on a module, to find out all its
  containing methods, along with other relevant information and even
  docstrings. <a href="https://www.askpython.com/python/built-in-methods/python-vars-method">more details...</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What are local variables and global variables in Python?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Global Variables</strong>: Variables declared outside a function or in global space are called global variables. These
  variables can be accessed/be referenced by any function in the program.</li>
<li>
<strong>Local Variables</strong>: Any variable assigned inside a block is known as a local variable. This variable is present in
  the
  local space <em>(unless explicitly declared as global)</em> and not in the global space.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: How can you share global variables across modules?</h5>
<p>To share global variables across modules within a single program, create a special module. Import the config module in
all modules of your application. The module will be available as a global variable across modules.</p>
<h5>Q: What is slicing in Python?</h5>
<p>Select and change (only mutable types) a specific region of the sequence. A mechanism to select a range of items from
sequence types like list, tuple, strings etc.:</p>

<p>In Python, list comprehensions provide an alternative to using the built-in map() and filter() functions.</p>
<h5>Q: What is the negative index in Python?</h5>
<p>For slicing/accessing from the end of list, types and other sequences.
Python sequences can be indexed with positive and negative numbers. For positive index, 0 is the first index, 1 is the
second index and so forth. For negative index, (-1) is the last index and (-2) is the second last index and so forth.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>demo_lst = [2, 33, 222, 14, 25] 
demo_lst[-1] &gt;&gt; 25.
</code></pre>

<h5>Q: What is type conversion?</h5>
<p>Way of conversion variable of one type to another. For this purpose we use built-in functions, e.g. <code>int()</code>, <code>float()</code>,
<code>str()</code>, <code>bool()</code>, <code>list()</code>, etc.</p>
<h5>Q: What is the <code>__init__.py</code> module? What is it for?</h5>
<p>The <code>__init__.py</code> files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to
prevent
directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module
search path. In the simplest case, <strong>init</strong>.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code (
initializing the module) for the package or set the <strong>all</strong> variable.
The <code>import</code> statement uses the following convention: if a package’s <code>__init__.py</code> code defines a list named <code>__all__</code>,
it is
taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when <code>from &lt;package_name&gt; import *</code> is encountered.</p>
<h5>Q: What is the attribute <strong>slots</strong>?</h5>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots"><strong>slots</strong></a>: Saves memory consumptions of a class and also
results in faster attribute access. Of course, it does impose limitations.</p>
<h5>Q: How do I see the object methods? How do you list the functions in a module?</h5>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(demo_obj)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()  # dir calls __dir__() internally
</code></pre>

<p>The built-in function <em>dir([object])</em> with an argument, attempts to return a list of valid attributes/members for
that object. Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope.</p>
<p>If the object has a method named <code>__dir__()</code>, this method will be called and must return the list of attributes.
This allows objects that implement a custom <code>__getattr__()</code> or <code>__getattribute__()</code> function to customize the
way <code>dir()</code>
reports their attributes.</p>
<p>If the object does not provide <code>__dir__()</code>, the function tries its best to gather information from the
object’s <code>__dict__</code>
attribute, if defined, and from its type object (ancestor classes). The resulting list is not necessarily
complete, and may be inaccurate when the object has a custom <code>__getattr__()</code>
. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dir-and-vars-in-python/">more details...</a></p>

<h5>Q: What is a module in Python? What is a Python package? What is the difference between packages and modules?</h5>
<p>A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix
<code>.py</code> appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global
variable <code>__name__</code>.</p>
<p>Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespaces by using “dotted module names”. Packages contain
modules (collection of modules (a “package”)).</p>

<h5>Q: What are decorators? How to create a custom decorator?</h5>
<p>A decorator is essentially a <em>callable object</em> that is used to modify or extend a function/method or class
definition.</p>
<p>One of the beauties of decorators is that a single decorator definition can be applied to multiple functions (or
classes). Much can thereby be accomplished with decorators that would otherwise require lots of boilerplate (or
even worse redundant!) code. Flask, for example, uses decorators as the mechanism for adding new endpoints to a web
application. Examples of some of the more common uses of decorators include adding synchronization, type
enforcement, logging, or pre- and post-conditions to a class or function.</p>
<p>Firstly, you have to know or remember that function names are references to functions and that we can assign
multiple names/”references” to the same function.</p>
<p>The next important fact is that we can delete one of the references without deleting the function itself.
Concepts to understand: <em>Functions as Parameters, Functions returning Functions</em></p>

<span class="c1"># but it has a design problem ‘cause func_a exists in the same program in 2 versions, before decoration and after decoration. It should be noted: this notation can be used only for third-party functions</span>
</pre>
<p>The decorator returns a modified object, e.g. a modified function, which is bound to the name used in the
definition.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>time_this</code> is a function just like any other and has one parameter.</li>
<li>Inside time_this we are defining a function. Every time <code>time_this</code> executes it will create a new function.</li>
<li>Timing code, just like before.</li>
<li>We call the original function and keep the result for later.</li>
<li>The rest of the timing code.</li>
<li>The rest of the timing code.</li>
<li>The new_function must act just like the original function and so returns the stored result.</li>
<li>The function created in time_this is finally returned.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only constraint upon the object returned by the decorator is that it can be used as a function – which basically
means it <strong>must be callable</strong>. Thus, any classes we use as decorators must implement <code>__call__()</code>. This method is
called, if the instance is called "like a function", i.e. using brackets.</p>

<h5>Q: What are <code>@classmethod</code>, <code>@staticmethod</code>, <code>@property</code>?</h5>
<p>The decorators that are used on functions defined within
classes. <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@sheena/essential-python-interview-questions-du107ozr6#question-9">Detailed example</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>@classmethod</strong>: A method that receives the class as an implicit argument (cls) instead of the instance (self);
  executing
  in context of the class</li>
<li>
<p><strong>@staticmethod</strong>: A method that does not receive the implicit argument self as a first argument; can access such
  method
  from instance and class itself as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; obj.hello()</code></li>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeClass.hello()</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>@property</strong>: Create functions for managing the getting, setting and deleting of an attribute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What is <code>self</code>?</h5>
<p><strong>Short Answer</strong>: Keyword used as “link” to the current object of class.</p>
<p><strong>Long Answer</strong>: <code>self</code> is an instance or an object of a class. In Python, this is explicitly included as the first
parameter.
The <code>self</code> in the <code>__init__</code> method refers to the newly created object while in other methods, it refers to the object
whose method was called.</p>
<h5>Q: Dunder or magic methods in Python</h5>
<p>Method names that have <code>__leading</code> and <code>trailing__</code> double underscores are reserved for special use like the <code>__init__</code>
for object constructors, or <code>__call__</code> to make object callable.</p>
<ol>
<li>We <strong>don't have to invoke them directly</strong>: e.g. instance creation &gt;&gt; <code>__new__()</code> &gt; <code>__init__()</code> are called behind the
   scene.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implement dunders as desired</strong> — It’s a core Python feature and should be used as
   needed. <a href="https://medium.com/python-features/magic-methods-demystified-3c9e93144bf7">more examples...</a><ol>
<li>We can write classes where the instances behave like functions with <code>__call__()</code>. Both functions and the
   instances of such classes are called callables.</li>
<li>We can do <code>operator overloading</code> (binary/unary, extended assignments, comparison) for the purpose of our class:
   imitation of numeric types<ol>
<li>If we have an expression <code>x + y</code> and <code>x</code> is an instance of <code>class K</code>, then Python will check the class
   definition
   of <code>K</code>. If <code>K</code> has a method <code>__add__</code> it will be called with <code>x.__add__(y)</code>, otherwise we will get an error.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Dunder methods can be used to <strong>emulate behavior of built-in types</strong> to user defined objects: container
   imitation (<code>__len__</code>); make object as collection (<code>__getitem__</code> realization of obj[key] syntax);</li>
<li>Object Representation: <code>__str__</code> , <code>__repr__</code> (is invoked, when object is inspected in interpreter session). On a
   high level, <code>__str__</code> is used for creating output for the end user while <code>__repr__</code> is mainly used for debugging
   and
   development. repr’s goal is to be unambiguous (‘’official”) and str’s is to be readable (“informal”).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Inventing our own dunders is highly discouraged</strong> — It’s best to stay away from using names that start and end with
   double underscores in our programs to avoid collisions with our own methods and attributes.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Q: What is <code>__init__()</code> in class?</h5>
<p>It's a method which is used for customization of the initial state of newly created objects/instances.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>def __init__(self, arg1, *data, **kwargs):  # __&lt;&gt;__ double underscores = dunder
    self.data_name = data[0]
    self.other_value = arg1
</code></pre>

<h5>Q: How to compare values of variables and two objects?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Value comparisons</strong>: The operators <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>!=</code> compare the values of two objects. The
  objects do not need
  to have the same type.</li>
<li>
<strong>Membership test operations</strong>: operators <code>in</code> and <code>not in</code> test for membership. x in s evaluates to True if x is a
  member of
  s, and False otherwise. x not in s returns the negation of x in s.</li>
<li>
<strong>Identity comparisons</strong>: operators <code>is</code> and <code>is not</code> test for an object’s identity: x is y is True if and only if x
  and y are
  the same object. An Object’s identity is determined using the <code>id()</code>. x is not y yields the inverse truth
  value.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What is <code>__new__()</code> method in class?</h5>
<p><code>__new__()</code> is the first step in instance construction, invoked <em>before</em> <code>__init__</code>. The <code>__new__()</code> is called with the
class as its first argument; its responsibility is to return a new instance of that class. Compare this to <code>__init__</code>:
it is called with an instance as its first argument, and it doesn't return anything; its responsibility
is to initialize the instance.</p>
<p>There are situations where a new instance is created without calling <code>__init__()</code> (for example when the instance is
loaded from a pickle). There is no way to create a new instance without calling <strong>new</strong> (although in some cases you can
get away with calling a base class's <code>__new__</code>).</p>
<p>Here is an example of a subclass that overrides <code>__new__()</code> - this is how you would normally use it.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">inch</span>(<span class="n">float</span>):
    “”<span class="n">Convert</span> <span class="nb">from</span> <span class="n">inch</span> <span class="nb">to</span> <span class="n">meter</span>.”””
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__new__</span>(<span class="n">cls</span>, <span class="n">arg</span>=<span class="mf">0.0</span>):
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">float</span>.<span class="n">__new__</span>(<span class="n">cls</span>, <span class="n">arg</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mf">0.0254</span>)
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">inch</span>(<span class="mi">12</span>)  <span class="c1"># 0.3048</span>
</code></pre>

<h5>Q: Explain how to make a Python script executable on Unix?</h5>
<p>You need to do 2 things:</p>
<p>1) the script file’s mode must be executable and
2) the first line must begin with #! followed by the path of the Python interpreter on your platform.</p>
<p>3) The first is done by executing <code>$ chmod +x scriptfile_name</code> or perhaps <code>$ chmod 755 scriptfile_name</code>.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ chmod +x myscript.py
</pre>
<p>The second can be done in a number of ways. The most straightforward way is to put</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="ch">#!/usr/local/bin/python</span>
<span class="c1"># !interpreter [arguments] #! - shebang</span>
</pre>
<p>If you would like the script to be independent of where the Python interpreter lives, you can use the “env” program.
Almost all Unix variants support the following, assuming the python interpreter is in a directory on the user’s <code>$PATH</code>:
<a href="http://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-make-a-python-script-executable-on-unix.htm">more details...</a></p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
</pre>
<h5>Q: What is pickling and unpickling?</h5>
<p>The <code>pickle</code> module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm (binary protocols) for serializing and
de-serializing a Python object structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pickling</strong> - is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream (a binary file or
  bytes-like object)</li>
<li>
<strong>Unpickling</strong> - is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pickle</span>

<span class="sd">"""</span>
<span class="sd">The difference between dump and dumps is that dump writes the pickled object to an open file, and dumps returns the pickled object as bytes.</span>
<span class="sd">The file must be opened for writing in binary mode. The pickled version of the object is exactly the same with both dump and dumps.</span>
<span class="sd">"""</span>
<span class="c1"># So, if you did the following for object obj:</span>
<span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"pickle1"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"wb"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">pickle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dump</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># b'\x80\x03c__main__\nexample_class\nq\x00)\x81q\x01.'</span>

<span class="c1"># you'd end up with two files with exactly the same contents.</span>

<span class="c1"># The same applies to loading - load "unpickles" from an open (readable) file object, and loads uses a bytes object.</span>

<span class="c1"># un-pickle</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">"someobject.pickle"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"rb"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">input_file</span><span class="p">:</span>

<h5>Q: What are serialization methods in Python (write some examples)?</h5>
<p>In the context of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a
format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted and reconstructed later.
Pickle, YAML,
JSON. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_python/object_oriented_python_serialization.htm">more details...</a></p>
<h5>Q: How can the ternary operators be used in Python?</h5>
<p><em>Blueprint</em>: <code>value_if_true if condition/expression else value_if_false</code>
<em>Example</em>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">is_nice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">True</span>
<span class="nv">state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">nice</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">is_nice</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">not nice</span><span class="s2">"</span>

<h5>Q: Does Python have a switch-case statement?</h5>
<p>Python doesn't have a switch-case statement until 3.10. Here, you may implement a switch function to use with a
dictionary. Else,
you may use a set of if-elif-else statements.</p>

<h5>Q: What are iterators?</h5>
<p>Iterator it’s an object (can be iterated upon) that has implemented 2 dunders, <code>__iter__()</code> and <code>__next__()</code>,
collectively called the iterator protocol. An object is called iterable if we can get an iterator from it. Most built-in
containers in Python like: list, tuple, string etc. are iterables.</p>
<p>How to iterate over all the items of an iterator?</p>
<ol>
<li>Manually with <code>next()</code>
</li>
<li>Automatically by using the <code>for</code> loop (can iterate over any object that can return an iterator). Is actually
   implemented as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators">docs.python.org</a>:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># create an iterator object from iterable</span>

        <span class="c1"># if StopIteration is raised, break from loop</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
</pre>
<h5>Q: What are generators?</h5>
<p>Primarily as syntactic sugar for implementing iterators (like it). Generators are regular functions but instead of using
the return statement, they use <code>yield</code> to pass data (“lazy iterator”) back to the caller. Whereas a return statement
disposes of a function’s local state, a <code>yield</code> statement suspends the function and retains its local state.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">def</span> <span class="nv">repeater</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">value</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="nv">True</span>:
        <span class="nv">yield</span> <span class="nv">value</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nv">repeater</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">Hey</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="ss">)</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">generator</span> <span class="nv">object</span> <span class="nv">repeater</span> <span class="nv">at</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="nv">x107bcdbf8</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The code in the generator function only executes when <code>next()</code> is called on the generator object:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">generator_obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">repeater</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">Hey</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="ss">)</span>
<span class="k">next</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">generator_obj</span><span class="ss">)</span>  # ‘<span class="nv">Hey</span>’
</code></pre>

<p>In practical terms, this means local variables and the execution state of the generator function are only stashed away
temporarily and not thrown out completely. Execution can be resumed at any time by calling <code>next()</code> on the generator.
This makes generators fully compatible with the iterator protocol.</p>
<p>Generators stop generating values as soon as control flow returns from the generator function by any means <em>other
than a yield statement</em>. This means you no longer have to worry about raising <code>StopIteration</code> at all.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>def repeat_three_times(value):
    yield value
    yield value
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll take advantage of the fact that Python adds an implicit return None statement to the end of every function.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">def</span> <span class="nv">bounded_repeater</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">value</span>, <span class="nv">max_repeats</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">i</span> <span class="nv">in</span> <span class="nv">range</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">max_repeats</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
        <span class="nv">yield</span> <span class="nv">value</span>
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract
  away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators (75% less code).</li>
<li>The <code>yield</code> statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass back values from
  it.</li>
<li>Generators start raising <code>StopIteration</code> exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means
  other
  than a <code>yield</code> statement.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What is generator expressions (also called a generator comprehension)?</h5>
<p>It has a very similar syntax to list/tuple comprehensions. In this way, we can use the generator without calling a
function.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># generator as a function</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">csv_reader</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file_name</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">row_</span>


<span class="n">csv_gen</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">csv_reader</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"some_csv.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">row_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">csv_gen</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">row_count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">"Row count is </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">row_count</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># Row count is 64186394</span>

<span class="c1"># generator expression</span>
<span class="n">csv_gen</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">row</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"file_name.txt"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>
<p>They’re also useful in the same cases where list comprehensions are used, with an added benefit: you can create them
without building and holding the entire object in memory before iteration. In other words, you’ll have <strong>no memory
penalty</strong>
when you use generator expressions. In a nutshell, iterating over a generator expression or list comprehension will
essentially do the same thing, but the list comprehension will create the entire list in memory first while the
generator expression will create the items on the fly as needed. Generator expressions can therefore be used for very
large (and even infinite) sequences and their lazy (i.e., on demand) generation of values results in improved
performance and lower memory usage. It is worth noting, though, that the standard Python list methods can be used on the
result of a list comprehension, but not directly on that of a generator expression.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>If <strong>speed is an issue</strong> and <strong>memory isn’t</strong>, then a list comprehension is likely a <em>better</em> tool for the job.</p>
<p>Generators have a fixed setup time that must be amortized over how many items are called. List comprehensions are faster
initially but will slow substantially as more memory is used with larger data
sets. <a href="https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/">more details...</a></p>
<h5>Q: What is a context manager?</h5>
<p>It’s a simple “protocol” (or interface) that your object needs to follow, so it can be used with the <code>with</code> statement.
Basically all you need to do is add <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> methods to an object if you want it to function as a
context manager. Python will call these two methods at the appropriate times in the resource management cycle.
A <em>context manager</em> defines the runtime context to be established when executing, e.g. a <code>with</code> statement. The context
manager handles the entry into, and the exit from, the desired runtime context for the execution of the block of code.
Context managers are normally invoked using the with statement, but can also be used by directly invoking their methods.
<a href="https://dbader.org/blog/python-context-managers-and-with-statement">more details1</a>
, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers">more details2</a></p>
<p>Typical uses of context managers include saving and restoring various kinds of global state, locking and unlocking
resources, closing opened files, etc.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">ManagedFile:</span>
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__init__</span>(<span class="nb">self</span>, <span class="nb">name</span>):
        <span class="nb">self</span>.<span class="nb">name</span> = <span class="nb">name</span>

    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__enter__</span>(<span class="nb">self</span>):
        <span class="nb">self</span>.<span class="nb">file</span> = <span class="nb">open</span>(<span class="nb">self</span>.<span class="nb">name</span>, <span class="s">'w'</span>)
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">self</span>.<span class="nb">file</span>


    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__exit__</span>(<span class="nb">self</span>, <span class="n">exc_type</span>, <span class="n">exc_val</span>, <span class="n">exc_tb</span>):
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">self</span>.<span class="n">file:</span>
            <span class="nb">self</span>.<span class="nb">file</span>.<span class="nb">close</span>()
</code></pre>

<p>Our ManagedFile class follows the context manager protocol and now supports the <code>with</code> statement, just like the
original <code>open()</code> example did:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>with ManagedFile('hello.txt') as f:
    f.write('hello, world!')
    f.write('bye now')
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Things to Remember</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>with</code> statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating standard uses of <code>try/finally</code> statements in
  so-called Context Managers.</li>
<li>Most commonly it is used to manage the safe acquisition and release of system resources. Resources are acquired by the
  <code>with</code> statement and released automatically when execution leaves the with context.</li>
<li>Using <code>with</code> effectively can help you avoid resource leaks and make your code easier to read.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q:  What are descriptors?</h5>
<p>They provide the developer with the ability to add managed attributes to object. The methods needed to create a
descriptor are <strong>get</strong>, <strong>set</strong> and <strong>delete</strong>. If you define any of these methods, then you have created a descriptor.</p>
<p>In general, a descriptor (it’s a mechanism) is an object attribute with “binding behavior”, one whose attribute access
has been overridden by methods in the descriptor protocol. Those methods are <strong>get</strong>(), <strong>set</strong>(), and <strong>delete</strong>(). If
any of those methods are defined for an object, it is said to be a descriptor.</p>
<p>The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the attribute from an object’s dictionary. For
instance, a.x has a lookup chain starting with a.<strong>dict</strong>['x'], then type(a).<strong>dict</strong>['x'], and continuing through the
base classes of type(a) excluding metaclasses. If the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor
methods, then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor method instead. Where this occurs in
the precedence chain depends on which descriptor methods were defined.</p>
<p>Descriptors are a powerful, general purpose protocol. They are the mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods,
class methods, and super(). They are used throughout Python itself to implement the new style classes introduced in
version 2.2. Descriptors simplify the underlying C-code and offer a flexible set of new tools for everyday Python
programs.</p>
<h5>Q: What is <code>lambda</code> function in Python?</h5>
<p>An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. This function can have any number of parameters, but can have
just <strong>one</strong> statement.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span>  <span class="c1"># but it's better to avoid giving name to "anonymous" func</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>
<h5>Q: What do we need <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code>: ?</h5>
<p>Its main purpose is to separate the code that will be executed when the code is called as a module (when imported into
another script) - and when the module itself is launched as a separate file.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code># <span class="nv">this</span> <span class="nv">means</span> <span class="nv">that</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">this</span> <span class="nv">script</span> <span class="nv">is</span> <span class="nv">executed</span>, <span class="k">then</span> <span class="nv">some_func</span><span class="ss">()</span> <span class="nv">will</span> <span class="nv">be</span> <span class="nv">executed</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">__main__</span><span class="s1">'</span>:
    <span class="nv">some_func</span><span class="ss">()</span>
</code></pre>

<h5>Q: What is <em>monkey patching</em> and is it ever a good idea?</h5>
<p>Term "monkey patch" refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module, changing the behavior of a
function/object after it has already been defined. Most of the time it's a pretty terrible idea - it is usually best if
things act in a well-defined way.</p>
<p>To patch module (or class) variables or functions is easy, because Python does not create protected or private entities
and in most cases it’s possible to get reference to them.</p>

<h5>Q: How are arguments passed by value or by reference?</h5>
<p><strong>Background knowledge</strong>:<br>
When you pass function arguments <strong>by reference</strong>, those arguments are only references to existing values. In contrast,
when
you pass arguments by value, those arguments become independent copies of the original values.
!!! Python passes arguments neither by reference nor by value, but <strong><em>by assignment</em></strong>. Python does not exactly pass by
value.
Let’s prove it. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-pass-by-reference/">more details...</a></p>
<p>Using <code>id(obj)</code> (returns an integer representing the memory address), you can verify the following assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Function arguments initially refer to the same address as their original variables.</li>
<li>Reassigning the argument within the function gives it a new address while the original variable remains unmodified.
   In the below example, note that the address of x initially matches that of n but changes after reassignment (for
   immutable data types), while the address of n never changes. If we have mutable types - after modification the
   address stays the same.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Q: What is <code>PYTHONPATH</code>?</h5>
<p><code>PYTHONPATH</code> is an <em>environment variable</em> which you can set to add additional directories where Python will look for
modules
and packages. Augment the default search path for module files. The format is the same as the shell’s <code>PATH</code>: one or
more
directory path names separated by os.pathsep (e.g. “:” on Unix or “;” on Windows). Non-existent directories are silently
ignored.</p>
<p>For most installations, you should not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run. Python knows
where to find its standard library. The only reason to set <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is to maintain directories of custom Python
libraries that you do not want to install in the global default location (i.e., the site-packages directory).</p>

<dt><mark>duck-typing</mark></dt>
<dd>A programming style which does not look at an object’s type to determine if it has the right interface; instead, the
method or attribute is simply called or used (“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.”) By
emphasizing interfaces rather than specific types, well-designed code improves its flexibility by allowing polymorphic
substitution. Duck-typing avoids tests using type() or isinstance(). (Note, however, that duck-typing can be
complemented with abstract base classes.) Instead, it typically employs hasattr() tests or EAFP programming.</dd>
<dt><mark>EAFP</mark></dt>
<dd>Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This common Python coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or
attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean and fast style is characterized by the
presence of many try and except statements. The technique contrasts with the LBYL style common to many other languages
such as C.</dd>

<p><strong>Most to least efficient</strong>: f2 -&gt; f1 -&gt; f3. To prove that this is the case, you would want to profile your code. Python

<p><strong>Why Care?</strong>
Locating and avoiding bottlenecks is often pretty worthwhile. A lot of coding for efficiency comes down to common sense</p>
<ul>
<li>in the example above it's obviously <em>quicker to sort a list if it's a smaller list</em>, so if you have the choice of
  filtering before a sort it's often a good idea. The less obvious stuff can still be located through use of the proper
  tools. It's good to know about these tools.</li>

<p><code>Module = =PyImport_ImportModule("&lt;modulename&gt;");</code></p>
<p><strong>Built-in constants</strong><br>
A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace: <strong>True</strong>, <strong>False</strong>, <strong>None</strong>, <strong>NotImplemented</strong>, <strong>
Ellipsis</strong>, <strong><strong>debug</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Constants added by the site module. They are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should not be used in

<p><strong>Built-in exceptions</strong><br>
A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error. An error can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>syntax error</em>: raised when the parser detects an incorrect statement, print(0/0))</li>
<li>an <em>exception</em>: raised when code with correct syntax results in an error, print(0/0)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>BaseException</code> base class for all built-in exceptions. It is not meant to be directly inherited by user-defined
classes (for that, use Exception).</p>

<h5>Q: Project configuration</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>mysite/<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/">settings.py</a>: A settings file is just a module with
  module-level variables.
  Because a settings file is a Python module, the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t allow for Python syntax errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can assign settings dynamically using normal Python syntax. For example:
  MY_SETTINGS = [str(i) for i in range(30)]</p>
</li>
<li>It can import values from other settings files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: Apps</h5>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ python manage.py startapp &lt;app_name&gt;

</h5>
<p>A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and
behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.</li>
<li>Each attribute of the model represents a database field.</li>
<li>With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API;</li>
</ul>
<p>from django.db import models</p>
<p>class Person(models.Model):
  first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
  last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)</p>
<p><code>first_name</code> and <code>last_name</code> are fields of the model. Each field is specified as a class attribute, and each attribute
maps to a database column.</p>
<p>The above Person model would create a database table like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">CREATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">TABLE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">myapp_person</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="ss">"id"</span><span class="w">         </span><span class="nb">serial</span><span class="w">      </span><span class="k">NOT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">NULL</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">PRIMARY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">KEY</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="ss">"first_name"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">NOT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="ss">"last_name"</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">NOT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">NULL</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre>
<h5>Q: Templates</h5>
<p>A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic
content will be inserted. A Django project can be configured with one or several template engines (or even zero if you
don’t use templates). Django ships built-in backends for its own template system, creatively called the Django template
language (DTL), and for the popular alternative Jinja2. Backends for other template languages may be available from
third-parties.</p>
<p>A Django template is a text document or a Python string marked-up using the Django template language. Some constructs
are recognized and interpreted by the template engine. The main ones are variables and tags.</p>
<p>A <strong>template is rendered with a context</strong>. Rendering replaces variables with their values, which are looked up in the
context, and executes tags. Everything else is output as is.</p>
<p>The syntax of the Django template language involves four constructs.</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>{{ variable }}</strong> outputs a value from the context, which is a dict-like object mapping keys to values.
   <code>My first name is {{ first_name }}. My last name is {{ last_name }}.</code>
   With a context of <code>{'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe'}</code> &gt;&gt; My first name is John. My last name is Doe.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>{% Tags %}</strong> provide arbitrary logic in the rendering process.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>{% csrf_token %}</code> or with arguments: <code>{% cycle 'odd' 'even' %}</code>
</li>
<li>Some tags require beginning and ending
  tags: <code>{% if user.is_authenticated %}Hello, {{ user.username }}.{% endif %}</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Filters</strong> transform the values of variables and tag arguments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>{{ django|title }}</code> or with an argument: <code>{{ my_date|date:"Y-m-d" }}</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Comments</strong> look like this: <code>{# this won't be rendered #}</code>. A <code>{% comment %}</code> tag provides multi-line comments.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Q: Forms</h5>
<p>In HTML, a form is a collection of elements inside <strong><code>&lt;form&gt;...&lt;/form&gt;</code></strong> that allow a visitor to do things like enter
text, select options, manipulate objects or controls, and so on, and then send that information back to the server.</p>
<p>As well as its <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements, a form must specify two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>where: the URL to which the data corresponding to the user’s input should be returned</li>
<li>how: the HTTP method the data should be returned by</li>
</ul>
<p>GET and POST are typically used for different purposes.</p>
<p>Any request that could be used to change the state of the system - for example, a request that makes changes in the
database - should use POST. GET should be used only for requests that do not affect the state of the system.</p>
<p>Django handles three distinct parts of the work involved in forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering</li>
<li>creating HTML forms for the data</li>
<li>receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of a Web application, ‘form’ might refer to that HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, or to the Django Form that produces it,
or to the structured data returned when it is submitted, or to the end-to-end working collection of these parts.</p>
<p>At the heart of this system of components is Django’s Form class. In much the same way that a Django model describes
the logical structure of an object, its behavior, and the way its parts are represented to us, a Form class describes
a form and determines how it works and appears.</p>
<p>In a similar way that a model class’s fields map to database fields, a form class’s fields map to HTML form <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
elements. (A ModelForm maps a model class’s fields to HTML form <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements via a Form; this is what the Django
admin is based upon)</p>
<h5>Q: django-admin</h5>
<p><strong>django-admin</strong> is Django’s command-line utility for administrative tasks.</p>
<p>In addition, <code>manage.py</code> is automatically created in each Django project. It does the same thing as <code>django-admin</code> but
also sets the <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> environment variable so that it points to your project’s settings.py file.</p>
<p>The <strong>django-admin</strong> script should be on your system path if you installed Django via <code>pip</code>. If it’s not in your path,
ensure you have your virtual environment activated.</p>
<p>Generally, when working on a single Django project, it’s easier to use <code>manage.py</code> than <code>django-admin</code>. If you need to
switch between multiple Django settings files, use <code>django-admin</code> with <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> or the <code>--settings</code>
command line option.</p>
<p>CLI examples can use django-admin/manage.py or python -m django just as well.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ django-admin &lt;command&gt; <span class="o">[</span>options<span class="o">]</span>
$ manage.py &lt;command&gt; <span class="o">[</span>options<span class="o">]</span>
$ python -m django &lt;command&gt; <span class="o">[</span>options<span class="o">]</span>
</pre>

<h4>VCS</h4>
<p><a href="https://adriaanrol.com/images/GitFlowchart.png"><img src="https://adriaanrol.com/images/GitFlowchart.png" alt=""></a></p>
<h5>Q: Types of Version Control Systems (VCS)</h5>
<p>VCSs are broken down into two main categories, <strong>(1) centralized</strong> and <strong>(2) decentralized</strong> (also known as distributed)
.</p>
<p><strong><em>Background knowledge</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Repository</em> model describes the relationship between various copies of the source code repository. In a (1)
  client–server model, users access a master repository via a client; typically, their local machines hold only a
  working copy of a project tree. Changes in one working copy must be committed to the master repository before they are
  propagated to other users. In a (2) distributed model, repositories act as peers, and users typically have a local
  repository with version history available, in addition to their working copies.</li>
<li>
<em>Concurrency</em> model describes how changes to the working copy are managed to prevent simultaneous edits from causing
  nonsensical data in the repository. In a lock model, changes are disallowed until the user requests and receives an
  exclusive lock on the file from the master repository. In a merge model, users may freely edit files, but are informed
  of possible conflicts upon checking their changes into the repository, whereupon the version control system may merge
  changes on both sides, or let the user decide when conflicts arise. Distributed version control systems usually use a
  merge concurrency model.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Centralized Version Control</em></strong></p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the most popular version control system is known as Apache® Subversion® (trunk). Other:
CVS, IBM ClearCase etc. The main concept of a centralized system is that it works in a client and server relationship.
The repository is located in one place and provides access to many clients. It’s very similar to FTP in that you have an
FTP client which connects to an FTP server. All changes, users, commits and information must be sent and received from
this central repository.</p>
<p><strong><em>Distributed Version Control</em></strong>
Distributed systems are a newer option. In distributed version control, each user has their own copy of the entire
repository, not just the files but the history as well. Think of it as a network of individual repositories. The two
most popular distributed version control systems are Git and Mercurial, also BitKeeper, Fossil etc.</p>
<h5>Q: Explain GitFlow</h5>
<p>Background knowledge:
When evaluating a workflow for your team, it's most important that you consider your team’s culture. You want the
workflow to enhance the effectiveness of your team and not be a burden that limits productivity.

<h3>A.4 Software Design and Development Process</h3>
<h4>Networking</h4>
<h6>Q: Fundamentals of HTTP/HTTPS</h6>
<p>They are application layer protocols designed to transfer information between networked devices and run on top of other
layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server,
which then sends a response message.</p>
<p>As a request-response protocol, HTTP gives users a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting
hypertext messages between clients and servers, sometimes via proxies. HTTP clients generally use Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) connections to communicate with servers.</p>
<p><strong>Can DDoS Attacks Be Launched Over HTTP?</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that HTTP is a “stateless” protocol, which means that each command runs independent of any other command.
In the original spec, HTTP requests each created and closed a TCP connection. In newer versions of the HTTP protocol (
HTTP 1.1 and above), persistent connection allows for multiple HTTP requests to pass over a persistent TCP connection,
improving resource consumption. In the context of DoS or DDoS attacks, HTTP requests in large quantities can be used to
mount an attack on a target device.<br><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/">more details...</a><br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview">more details2...</a><br><a href="https://cascadingmedia.com/insites/2015/03/http-2.html">more on HTTP/2</a></p>
<h5>Q: What is DNS?</h5>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names,
like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain
names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.</p>
<p>Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers
eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric
IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).</p>
<p><strong>The 8 steps in a DNS lookup:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A user types ‘example.com’ into a web browser and the query travels into the Internet and is received by a DNS
   recursive resolver.</li>
<li>The resolver then queries a DNS root nameserver (.).</li>
<li>The root server then responds to the resolver with the address of a Top Level Domain (TLD) DNS server (such as .com
   or .net), which stores the information for its domains. When searching for example.com, our request is pointed toward
   the .com TLD.</li>
<li>The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.</li>
<li>The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain’s nameserver, example.com.</li>
<li>Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain’s nameserver.</li>
<li>The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.</li>
<li>The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.
   Once the 8 steps of the DNS lookup have returned the IP address for example.com, the browser is able to make the
   request for the web page</li>
<li>The browser makes a HTTP request to the IP address.</li>
<li>The server at that IP returns the webpage to be rendered in the browser (step 10).<br><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">more details...</a>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>Q: Explain how request / response work</h5>
<p><em>What’s in an HTTP request?</em>
Each HTTP request made across the Internet carries with it a series of encoded data that carries different types of
information.</p>
<p>A typical HTTP request contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>HTTP version type</li>
<li>a URL</li>
<li>an HTTP method</li>
<li>HTTP request headers</li>
<li>Optional HTTP body</li>
</ol>
<p><em>What’s in an HTTP response?</em>
An HTTP response is what web clients (often browsers) receive from an Internet server in answer to an HTTP request.
These responses communicate valuable information based on what was asked for in the HTTP request.</p>
<p>A typical HTTP response contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>an HTTP status code</li>
<li>HTTP response headers</li>
<li>optional HTTP body</li>
</ol>
<h5>Q: Describe the client / server model</h5>
<p>The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workload between the providers
of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when
the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested
process and delivers the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources.
Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How does the Client-Server Model work?</strong></p>
<p>In this article we are going to take a dive into the <em>Client-Server</em> model and have a look at how the Internet works via
web browsers. This article will help us in having a solid foundation of the WEB and help in working with WEB
technologies with ease.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Client</em>: When we talk about the word Client, it means to talk of a person or an organization using a particular
  service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a
  particular service from the service providers (Servers).</li>
<li>
<em>Server</em>: Similarly, when we talk about the word Servers, It means a person or medium that serves something. Similarly
  in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular
  services.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it's basically the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as its present in the database.</p>
<p><strong>How does the browser interact with the servers?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>User enters the URL(Uniform Resource Locator) of the website or file. The Browser then requests the DNS(DOMAIN NAME
   SYSTEM) Server.</li>
<li>DNS Server lookup for the address of the WEB Server.</li>
<li>DNS Server responds with the IP address of the WEB Server.</li>
<li>Browser sends over an HTTP/HTTPS request to WEB Server’s IP (provided by DNS server).</li>
<li>Server sends over the necessary files of the website.</li>
<li>Browser then renders the files and the website is displayed. This rendering is done with the help of DOM (Document
   Object Model) interpreter, CSS interpreter and JS Engine collectively known as the JIT or (Just in Time) Compilers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages of Client-Server model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized system with all data in a single place.</li>
<li>Cost efficiency requires less maintenance cost and Data recovery is possible.</li>
<li>The capacity of the Client and Servers can be changed separately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of Client-Server model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clients are prone to viruses, Trojans and worms if present in the Server or uploaded into the Server.</li>
<li>Servers are prone to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.</li>
<li>Data packets may be spoofed or modified during transmission.</li>
<li>Phishing or capturing login credentials or other useful information of the user are common and MITM(Man in the Middle)
  attacks are common.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multithreading Programming</h4>
<h5>Q: Can you write multithreading applications in Python? What is the difference between multithreading, multiprocessing?</h5>
<p>There are two types of multitasking in OS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread-based parallelism (Multithreading)</li>
<li>Process-based parallelism (Multiprocessing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Multithreading in Python is sort of a myth.</p>
<p>There's technically nothing forbidding multiple threads from trying to access the same resource at the same time. The
result is usually not desirable, so things like locks, mutexes, and resource managers were developed. They're all
different ways to ensure <strong>that only one thread can access a given CPU resource at a time</strong> (aka GIL). In essence, they
make threads play nice together. However, if a lot of the threads' time is spent waiting for resources, you're not
getting any benefits from multithreading, and you'd be better off writing a single-threaded program instead (or
restructuring your program to avoid the waiting). “True” multithreading can be used only when the dependency between
individual threads does not exist.</p>
<p>That being said, in CPython (the most prevalent Python implementation), there's this evil necessity called the Global
Interpreter Lock (GIL). In order to make the dynamic memory management in CPython work correctly, the GIL prevents
multiple threads from running Python code at the same time. This is because CPython's dynamic memory management is not
thread-safe - it can have those same problems of multiple threads accessing (or worse, disposing) the same resource at
the same time. Python threads still work for I/O bound tasks as opposed to CPU bound tasks which may cause deadlocks
and race conditions.</p>
<p>The GIL was a compromise between the 2 extremes of not allowing multi-threaded code, and having the dynamic memory
management be very bulky and slow.</p>
<p>Jython, IronPython (but not PyPy) don't have a GIL, because the platforms they are built on (Java, .NET) handle
dynamic memory management differently, and so can safely run the Python code in multiple threads at the same time.</p>
<p>There are reasons to use the threading package. If you want to run some things simultaneously, and efficiency is not a
concern, then it's totally fine and convenient. Or if you are running code that needs to wait for something (like some
IO) then it could make a lot of sense. But the threading library won't let you use extra CPU cores.</p>
<p>Multi-threading can be outsourced to the OS (by doing multi-processing), some external application that calls your
Python code (eg, Spark or Hadoop), or some code that your Python code calls (eg, you could have your Python code call
a C function that does the expensive multi-threaded stuff).</p>
<p>If you're using CPython, it's highly recommended to use the multiprocessing module instead. Rather than running
multiple threads, it runs multiple processes (each with their own GIL, so they can all run at the same time). It's
much more effective than multithreading. The alternative is to write your multithreaded code in C/C++ as an extension,
because native code is not subject to the GIL. However, that's usually a lot more work, and the payoff is usually not
worth the effort.</p>
<h5>Q: Explain the basic primitives and multithreading concept of Python</h5>
<dl>
<dt>thread</dt>
<dd>A thread is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have two things happening at once. But for
most Python 3 implementations the different threads do not actually execute at the same time: they merely appear to.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It’s tempting to think of threading as having two (or more) different processors running on your program, each one doing
an independent task at the same time. That’s almost right. The threads may be running on different processors, but they
will only be running one at a time.</p>
<p>Getting multiple tasks running simultaneously requires a non-standard implementation of Python, writing some of your
code in a different language, or using multiprocessing which comes with some extra overhead.</p>
<p>Because of the way CPython implementation of Python works, threading may not speed up all tasks. This is due to
interactions with the GIL that essentially limit one Python thread to run at a time.
Tasks that spend much of their time waiting for external events are generally good candidates for threading. Problems
that require heavy CPU computation and spend little time waiting for external events might not run faster at all.</p>
<p>This is true for code written in Python and running on the standard CPython implementation. If your threads are written
in C they have the ability to release the GIL and run concurrently. If you are running on a different Python
implementation, check with the documentation to see how it handles threads.</p>
<p>If you are running a standard Python implementation, writing in only Python, and have a CPU-bound problem, you should
check out the multiprocessing module instead.</p>
<p>Architecting your program to use threading can also provide gains in design clarity. Using threading in them helps to
make the design cleaner and easier to reason about.</p>
<p>To start a separate thread, you create a Thread instance and then tell it to start:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>x = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(1,))
x.start()
</code></pre>

<p>When you create a Thread, you pass it a function and a list containing the arguments to that function. In this case,
you’re telling the Thread to run thread_function() and to pass it 1 as an argument.</p>
<h5>Q: Explain the concept of the general synchronization blocks (like mutex, semaphore)</h5>
<p>Proper synchronization between multiple threads using <code>Locks</code>
<code>threading</code> module provides a <code>Lock</code> class to deal with the race conditions. Lock is implemented using a <code>Semaphore</code>
object
provided by the Operating System.</p>
<p><em>A semaphore is a synchronization object that controls access by multiple processes/threads to a common resource in a
parallel programming environment. It is simply a value in a designated place in operating system (or kernel) storage
that each process/thread can check and then change. Depending on the value that is found, the process/thread can use the
resource or will find that it is already in use and must wait for some period before trying again. Semaphores can be
binary (0 or 1) or can have additional values. Typically, a process/thread using semaphores checks the value and then,
if it is using the resource, changes the value to reflect this so that subsequent semaphore users will know to wait.</em></p>
<p>A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each <code>acquire()</code> call and incremented by
each <code>release()</code>
call. The counter can never go below zero; when <code>acquire()</code> finds that it is zero, it blocks, waiting until some other
thread calls <code>release()</code>.

<h4>Object-Oriented Design/Architecture Approaches</h4>
<ul>
<li>Classes in Python are objects too</li>
<li>Dynamically changing and adding class attributes is allowed</li>
<li>The life cycle of an object can be managed</li>
<li>Many operators can be reloaded</li>
<li>Many of the built-in object methods can be emulated</li>
<li>Syntax conventions are used to hide internal data</li>
<li>Inheritance is supported</li>
<li>Polymorphism is provided by the virtuality of all methods</li>
<li>Metaprogramming is available</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: Does Python fully support OOP?</h5>
<p>Yes. Python supports all the concepts of "object-oriented programming" (Classes, Encapsulation, Polymorphism,
Inheritance) but it is NOT fully object-oriented because the code in Python can also be written without creating
classes.</p>
<h5>Q: Tell a brief overview of the 4 Python coding styles</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Functional</strong>: Every statement is treated as a mathematical equation and any forms of state or mutable data are
   avoided.
   The main advantage of this approach is that it lends itself well to parallel processing because there is no state to
   consider. Many developers prefer this coding style for recursion and for lambda calculus. (Note that Python’s
   implementation of functional programming deviates from the standard—read, is impure— because it’s possible to
   maintain state and create side effects if you’re not careful. If you need a pure functional programming
   implementation, Haskell may be a better choice.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Imperative</strong>: Computation is performed as a direct change to program state. This style is especially useful when
   manipulating data structures and produces elegant yet simple code. Python fully implements this paradigm.</li>
<li>
<strong>Object-oriented</strong>: Relies on data fields that are treated as objects and manipulated only through prescribed
   methods.
   Python doesn’t fully support this paradigm (debatable) because it can’t implement features such as data hiding (
   encapsulation), which many believe is a primary requirement of the object-oriented programming paradigm. This coding
   style also favors code reuse.</li>
<li>
<strong>Procedural</strong>: Tasks are treated as step-by-step iterations where common tasks are placed in functions that are
   called
   as needed. This coding style favors iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization. Python excels in
   implementing this particular
   paradigm. <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/python-programming-styles/">more details...</a>

<h5>Q: Explain Encapsulation in Python</h5>
<p>The idea that data inside the object should only be accessed through a <strong>public interface</strong> – that is, the object’s
methods, public getter and setter. Encapsulation is a process of wrapping methods and data together into a single unit.</p>
<p>In Python, encapsulation is not enforced by the language, but there is a convention that we can use to indicate that
a property is intended to be private and is not part of the object’s public interface: we begin its name with an _
underscore/__dunder.</p>
<p><strong>_spam</strong> &gt;&gt; “private”, just a convention
“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. A name prefixed
with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or
a data member).</p>
<p><strong>__spam</strong> &gt;&gt; half-protected with <code>AttributeError</code> if try direct access and full access
via <code>&lt;object_name&gt;._className__attrName</code></p>
<p>Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by
subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called <code>name mangling</code>. Any identifier of the form __spam (
at
least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _classname__spam, where
classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped.
Instead of manually creating getters and setters for each attribute, you can overload the built-in <code>__getattr__</code>
, <code>__setattr__</code>, and <code>__delattr__</code> methods.</p>
<h5>Q: Explain Inheritance in Python with an example</h5>
<p>Inheritance is a way of creating a new class and gaining all the attributes/methods of another class without modifying
it. The class from which we are inheriting is called <strong>super class</strong> and the class that is inherited is called a <strong>
derived / child class</strong>.</p>
<p>Inheritance provides the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It represents real-world relationships well (with composition concept)</li>
<li>It provides reusability of code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more
  features to a class without modifying it</li>
<li>It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B
  would automatically inherit from class A</li>
</ul>
<p>They are different types of inheritance supported by Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Single Inheritance</em> – where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class (aka child/one parent)</li>
<li>
<em>Multiple Inheritance</em> – a derived class is inherited from more than one base class (aka child/parents)</li>
<li>
<em>Multilevel Inheritance</em> – a derived class d1 is inherited from base class b1, and b1 is inherited from b0 (aka child
  and grandfather)</li>
<li>
<em>Hierarchical inheritance</em> – from one base class you can inherit any number of child classes (aka many childs/parent)</li>
<li>
<em>Hybrid Inheritance</em> – consisting of multiple types of
  inheritance  <a href="https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/#what-are-inheritance-and-composition">more details...</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: Explain Abstraction in Python</h5>
<p>It is providing only the required details and hiding the implementation from the world. It can be achieved by using
interfaces and abstract classes.</p>
<h5>Q: Explain Polymorphism in Python</h5>
<p>Using the same interface for multiple forms (data types).</p>
<ol>
<li>Child class redefines the parent method (which is called in this case “virtual”), has the same name and does the same
   thing in different ways.</li>

<h5>Q: Composition and object construction</h5>
<p>Composition is an OOD concept that models a relationship. In composition, a class known as <code>composite</code> contains an
object
of another class known as <code>component</code>. In other words, a composite class <strong>has-a</strong> component of another class.</p>
<p>Composition allows composite classes to reuse the implementation of the components it contains. The composite class
does not inherit the component class interface, but it can leverage its implementation.</p>
<p>The composition relation between two classes is considered <strong>loosely coupled</strong>. That means that changes to the component
class rarely affect the composite class, and changes to the composite class never affect the component class.</p>
<p>This provides better adaptability to change and allows applications to introduce new requirements without affecting
existing code.</p>
<p>When looking at 2 competing software designs, based on inheritance vs based on composition, the composition solution
usually is the most
flexible. <a href="https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/#what-are-inheritance-and-composition">more details...</a></p>
<p>Relationships like this can be one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many, and they can be unidirectional or bidirectional,
depending on the specifics of the roles which the objects fulfill. According to some formal definitions the term
composition implies that the two objects are quite strongly linked – one object can be thought of as belonging
exclusively to the other object. If the owner object ceases to exist, the owned object will probably cease to exist as
well.
<strong>Aggregation</strong> - if the link between two objects is weaker, and neither object has exclusive ownership of the other.

<h4>Data Types and Algorithms</h4>
<h5>Q: What are arrays, linked lists, sets, dicts (hash maps)?</h5>
<p>Data structures are the fundamental constructs around which you build your programs. Each data structure provides a

<h5>Q: Explain most used SQL queries commands</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SELECT</code> operator in SQL is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called
  the result-set. SELECT * FROM myDB.students;
  Some common SQL clauses used in conjunction with a SELECT query are as follows:</li>
<li>
<code>WHERE</code> clause is used to filter records that are necessary, based on specific conditions.</li>
<li>
<code>ORDER BY</code> clause is used to sort the records based on some field(s) in ascending (<code>ASC</code>) or descending order (<code>DESC</code>)
  .</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"></span>

<h5>Q: Explain the basics of Key-value, document, column-family databases and form of aggregate-oriented databases</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.guru99.com/nosql-tutorial.html">more details...</a>
, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/scale/types-of-nosql-databases#key-value-stores">more details1...</a></p>
<p><strong>Key Value Pair Based</strong></p>
<p>Data is stored in key/value pairs. It is designed in such a way to handle lots of data and heavy load.
Key-value pair storage databases store data as a hash table where each key is unique, and the value can be a JSON, BLOB(
Binary Large Objects), string, etc. It is one of the most basic types of NoSQL databases. This kind of NoSQL database is
used as a collection, dictionaries, associative arrays, etc. Key value stores help the developer to store schema-less
data. Use cases include shopping carts, user preferences, and user profiles.
Redis, Dynamo, Riak are some examples of key-value store DataBases. They are all based on Amazon's Dynamo paper.</p>
<p><strong>Column-based</strong></p>
<p>Column-oriented databases work on columns and are based on BigTable paper by Google. Every column is treated separately.
Values of single column databases are stored contiguously.
They deliver high performance on aggregation queries like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN etc. as the data is readily available in
a column.
Column-based NoSQL databases are widely used to manage data warehouses, business intelligence, CRM, Library card
catalogs. HBase, Cassandra, HBase, Hypertable are examples of column based databases.</p>
<p><strong>Document-Oriented</strong>
Document-Oriented NoSQL DB stores and retrieves data as a key value pair but the value part is stored as a document. The
document is stored in JSON or XML formats. The value is understood by the DB and can be queried.</p>
<p>In this diagram on your left you can see we have rows and columns, and in the right, we have a document database which
has a similar structure to JSON. Now for the relational database, you have to know what columns you have and so on.
However, for a document database, you have a data store like JSON object. You are not required to define which makes it
flexible.
The document type is mostly used for CMS systems, blogging platforms, real-time analytics &amp; e-commerce applications. It
should not be used for complex transactions which require multiple operations or queries against varying aggregate
structures.
Amazon SimpleDB, CouchDB, MongoDB, Riak, Lotus Notes, MongoDB, are popular Document originated DBMS systems.</p>
<p><strong>Graph-Based</strong>
A graph type database stores entities as well the relations amongst those entities. The entity is stored as a node with
the relationship as edges. An edge gives a relationship between nodes. Every node and edge has a unique identifier.</p>
<p>Compared to a relational database where tables are loosely connected, a Graph database is multi-relational in nature.
Traversing relationship is fast as they are already captured into the DB, and there is no need to calculate them.
Graph based database mostly used for social networks, logistics, spatial data.
Neo4J, Infinite Graph, OrientDB, FlockDB are some popular graph-based databases.</p>
<h5>Q: How to make optimization of the existing SQL queries and approaches of data storing/managing?</h5>
<p><a href="https://jaxenter.com/6-ways-optimize-sql-database-136448.html">more details...</a>
, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/sql-server/sql-database-tuning-for-developers">more details1...</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Proper indexing</strong>
   Index is basically a data structure that helps speed up the data retrieval process overall. Unique index is a kind of
   indexing that creates separate data columns without overlapping each other. Proper indexing ensures quicker access to
   the database. Excessive indexing or no indexing at all are both wrong. Without any indexing at all, the processing
   will be very slow, whereas indexing everything will render the insert and update triggers ineffective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieve the relevant data only</strong>
   Specifying the data one requires enables precision in retrieval. Using the commands * and LIMIT, instead of SELECT *
   as and when required is a great way of tuning the database, while avoiding retrieving the whole set of data when the
   user wants only a certain part of it. Of course, it will not be necessary when the amount of data overall is less.
   But when accessing data from a large source, specifying the portions required would save a lot of essential time.
   The <code>*</code> command is for use in specifying data from columns, and the LIMIT command is when the user requires data from
   a certain number of rows from among the lot. Selecting sparingly is not exactly a necessary rule. However, it does
   help in avoiding system errors in the future. Also, limiting and specifying the data reduces the further necessity of
   optimizing the database to a great deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting rid of correlated sub queries</strong>
   A correlated sub-query basically depends on the parent or outer query. This kind of search is done row by row. That
   means it decreases the overall speed of the process. This problem usually lies in the command of WHERE from the outer
   query, applying which, the subquery runs for each row, returned by the parent query, consequently slowing the whole
   process and reducing the efficiency of the database. So, a better way of tuning the database, in this case, is to the
   INNER JOIN command, instead of the correlated sub-query. But in certain cases, using correlated sub-query is
   essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using or avoiding temporary tables according to requirement</strong>
   If any code can be well written in a simple way, there is absolutely no need to make it complex with temporary
   tables. Of course, if a data has a specific procedure to be set up which requires multiple queries, the use of
   temporary tables in such cases are, in fact, recommended. Temporary tables are often alternated by sub-queries, but
   one has to keep in mind the specific efficiency that each of these would provide in separate cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid coding loops</strong>
   Avoiding coding loops is very much needed in order to avoid slowing down of the whole sequence. This can be achieved
   by using the unique UPDATE or INSERT commands with individual rows, and by ensuring that the command WHERE does not
   update the stored data in case it finds a matching pre existing data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution plans</strong>
   The execution plan tool created by the optimizer plays a major role in tuning SQL databases. They help in creating
   proper indexes too. Although, its main function is to display graphically the various methods to retrieve data. This,
   in turn, helps in creating the needed indexes and doing the other required steps to optimize the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, there are tons of other ways one can tune their SQL database in the most efficient manner. Also, there is a
big chance that the steps mentioned above might not be the right choice for all databases. Each database will require
optimization techniques uniquely specific to its needs.</p>
<h4>Unit Testing</h4>
<h5>Q: What’s your approach to unit testing in Python?</h5>
<p>The most fundamental answer to this ? centers around <code>unittest</code> testing framework.
<strong>unittest</strong> supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into
collections,
and independence of the tests from the reporting framework. The unittest module provides classes that make it easy to
support these qualities for a set of tests; key elements of the unittest framework - test fixtures, test cases, test
suites and test runners.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://pypi.org/project/mock/">mock</a></dt>
<dd>The value and power of mock are well explained in An Introduction to Mocking in Python. As noted, system calls are
prime candidates for mocking: whether writing a script to eject a CD drive, a web server which removes antiquated cache
files from /tmp, or a socket server which binds to a TCP port, these calls all feature undesired side-effects in the
context of unit tests. Similarly, keeping your unit-tests efficient and performant means keeping as much “slow code” as
possible out of the automated test runs, namely file system and network access. other test libraries</dd>
</dl>
<h5>Q: What are the key elements of the unittest framework?</h5>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a> contains both a <strong>testing framework</strong> and a <strong>test
runner</strong>. It has some important requirements for writing and
executing tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>You put your tests into classes as methods</li>
<li>You use a series of special assertion methods in the <code>unittest.TestCase</code> class instead of the built-in <code>assert</code>
  statement</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>unittest</code> supports some important concepts in an object-oriented way:</dt>
<dt>test fixture</dt>
<dd>A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associated cleanup actions.
This may involve, for example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server process.</dd>
<dt>test case</dt>
<dd>A test case is the individual unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs.
unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.</dd>
<dt>test suite</dt>
<dd>A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is used to aggregate tests that should be
executed together.</dd>
<dt>test runner</dt>
<dd>A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user. The
runner may use a graphical interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of
executing the tests.

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<h5>Q: What levels of requirements exist?</h5>
<p>Requirement analysis starts with:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Requirement gathering</strong> which is also called <em>elicitation</em>.</li>
<li>This is followed by <strong>analyzing</strong> the collected requirements to understand the correctness and feasibility of
   converting
   these requirements into a possible product.</li>
<li>And finally, <strong>documenting</strong> the requirements collected.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Requirement Gathering</h6>
<p>To make sure that all the steps mentioned above are appropriately executed, clear, concise, and correct requirements
must be gathered from the customer. The customer should be able to define their requirements properly and the business
analyst should be able to collect it the same way the customer is intending it to convey.
Many a time it is not possible that requirement gathering is done efficiently by business analysts from the customer.
This might be due to dependency on many people related to the expected end product, tools, environment, etc. Thus, it is
always a good idea to involve all the stakeholders who could influence or could be influenced by the end product.
The possible stakeholder’s group could be Software Quality engineers (both QC and QA), any third party vendor who could
provide support in the project, end-user for whom the product is intended for, software programmers, another team within
the organization who might provide a module or software platform, software libraries, etc. for product development.</p>
<h6>What is a Functional Requirements?</h6>
<p>In software engineering, a functional requirement defines a system or its components. It describes the functions a
software must perform. A function is nothing but inputs, its behavior, and outputs. It can be a calculation, data
manipulation, business process, user interaction, or any other specific functionality which defines what function a
system is likely to perform.
Functional software requirements help you to capture the intended behavior of the system. This behavior may be expressed
as functions, services or tasks or which system is required to perform.</p>
<h6>What is a Non-Functional Requirements?</h6>
<p>A non-functional requirement defines the quality attribute of a software system. They represent a set of standards used
to judge the specific operation of a system. Example, how fast does the website load?
A non-functional requirement is essential to ensure the usability and effectiveness of the entire software system.
Failing to meet non-functional requirements can result in systems that fail to satisfy user needs.
Non-functional Requirements allows you to impose constraints or restrictions on the design of the system across the
various agile backlogs. Example, the site should load in 3 seconds when the number of simultaneous users is &gt; 10000.
Description of non-functional requirements is just as critical as a functional requirement.</p>
<p><strong>KEY DIFFERENCE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A functional requirement defines a system or its component whereas a non-functional requirement defines the
  performance attribute of a software system.</li>
<li>Functional requirements along with requirement analysis help identify missing requirements while the advantage of
  Non-functional requirement is that it helps you to ensure good user experience and ease of operating the software.</li>
<li>Functional Requirement is a verb while Non-Functional Requirement is an attribute</li>
<li>Types of Non-functional requirement are Scalability Capacity, Availability, Reliability, Recoverability, Data
  Integrity, etc. whereas transaction corrections, adjustments, and cancellations, Business Rules, Certification
  Requirements, Reporting Requirements, Administrative functions, Authorization levels, Audit Tracking, External
  Interfaces, Historical Data management, Legal or Regulatory Requirements are various types of functional requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Examples of Functional Requirements</strong></h6>
<ul>
<li>The software automatically validates customers against the ABC Contact Management System</li>
<li>The Sales system should allow users to record customers sales</li>
<li>The background color for all windows in the application will be blue and have a hexadecimal RGB color value of
  0x0000FF.</li>
<li>Only Managerial level employees have the right to view revenue data.</li>
<li>The software system should be integrated with banking API</li>
<li>The software system should pass Section 508 accessibility requirement.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Examples of Non-functional requirements</strong></h6>
<ul>
<li>Users must change the initially assigned login password immediately after the first successful login. Moreover, the
  initial should never be reused.</li>
<li>Employees are never allowed to update their salary information. Such an attempt should be reported to the security
  administrator.</li>
<li>Every unsuccessful attempt by a user to access an item of data shall be recorded on an audit trail.</li>
<li>A website should be capable enough to handle 20 million users with affecting its performance</li>
<li>The software should be portable. So moving from one OS to another OS does not create any problem.</li>
<li>Privacy of information, the export of restricted technologies, intellectual property rights, etc. should be audited.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Functional Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helps you to check whether the application is providing all the functionalities that were mentioned in the functional
  requirement of that application</li>
<li>A functional requirement document helps you to define the functionality of a system or one of its subsystems.</li>
<li>Functional requirements along with requirement analysis help identify missing requirements. They help clearly define
  the expected system service and behavior.</li>
<li>Errors caught in the Functional requirement gathering stage are the cheapest to fix.</li>
<li>Support user goals, tasks, or activities for easy project management</li>
<li>Functional requirement can be expressed in Use Case form or user story as they exhibit externally visible functional
  behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Non-Functional Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The nonfunctional requirements ensure the software system follows legal and compliance rules.</li>
<li>They ensure the reliability, availability, and performance of the software system</li>
<li>They ensure good user experience and ease of operating the software.</li>
<li>They help in formulating security policy of the software system.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q: What are Excellent Requirements? What characteristics do they have?</h5>
<p>A requirement needs to meet several criteria to be considered a “good requirement”. Good requirements should have the
following characteristics: <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1152528&amp;seqNum=4">more details...</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Unambiguous (Однозначні)</li>
<li>Testable (verifiable)</li>
<li>Clear (concise, terse, simple, precise)</li>
<li>Correct</li>
<li>Understandable</li>
<li>Feasible (realistic, possible)</li>
<li>Independent</li>
<li>Atomic</li>
<li>Necessary</li>
<li>Implementation-free (abstract)</li>
</ul>
<p>Beside these criteria for individual requirements, 3 criteria apply to the set of requirements. The set should be</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent (Послідовний)</li>
<li>Non redundant (Не надлишковий)</li>
<li>Complete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Creates the list of effective and forward-looking questions to clarify inaccurate requirements, in order to
receive the "Yes/No" answer and finalize requirements into clear, specific and verifiable items.</p>
<h4>Estimation &amp; Time management</h4>
<h5>Q: Estimation fundamentals: decomposition, law of large numbers, cone of uncertainty, “count, compute, judge“ principle</h5>
<p><strong>Estimation</strong> determines how much money, effort, resources, and time it will take to build a specific system or
product.</p>
<p>Estimation is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past Data/Experience</li>
<li>Available Documents/Knowledge</li>
<li>Assumptions</li>
<li>Identified Risks</li>
</ul>
<p>The 4 basic steps in Software Project Estimation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimate the size of the development product.</li>
<li>Estimate the effort in person-months or person-hours.</li>
<li>Estimate the schedule in calendar months.</li>
<li>Estimate the project cost in agreed currency.</li>
</ul>
<h6>
<strong>Estimation methods</strong> <a href="https://massmediagroup.pro/PDF/SK903V1_WP_Estimating.pdf">full presentation</a>
</h6>
<p>A. Historical data<br>
B. Counting<br>
C. Decomposition</p>
<p><em>Decomposition</em>: Once the user stories has been selected, each is decomposed into the set of tasks necessary to deliver
the new functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the division of work into “bite -size” components</li>
<li>Techniques are:<ul>
<li>Decomposition into WBS (Methodology Work Breakdown Structure)</li>
<li>Decomposition of functions (The individual elements of the process and their hierarchical relationship to each
  other are commonly displayed in a diagram called <em>a functional decomposition diagram</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Still requires historical data and counts:</li>
<li>List of tasks</li>
<li>Counting the functions …</li>
<li>Benefits from the law of large numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>D. Law of large numbers: Task-based estimation averages out errors, through the Law Of Large Numbers (According to the
law,
the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to
become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed).</p>
<p>E. The Cone of Uncertainty, described by Steve McConnel, shows what any experienced software professional knows. Which
is
at the beginning of any project we don’t know exactly how long a project is going to
take. <a href="http://www.agilenutshell.com/cone_of_uncertainty">detailed description</a></p>
<p>The reasons for this are many. No 2 ever projects have:</p>
<ol>
<li>The same requirements.</li>
<li>The same people.</li>
<li>The same business context.</li>
<li>The same technology.</li>
<li>The same priorities &amp; constraints.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h4>One virtual environment per project</h4>
<ul>
<li>Isolation</li>
<li>Different projects have different dependency versions</li>
<li>You don't want to mess up the system Python</li>
</ul>
<h4>Structure your code and projects</h4>
<ul>
<li>Package and module structure gives an overview about the project</li>
<li>Modular design == better re-usability</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block">Don't put too much stuff into one module  
Split the project into packages  
Be consistent with your naming conventions  
</pre>
<h4>Utilize the capabilities of your editor</h4>
<ul>
<li>Efficient and fluent development</li>
<li>There's plenty of tools to make your daily programming easier, why would you not use them</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use existing solutions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Python Standard Library is extensive - and stable!</li>
<li>There are 370k+ packages in PyPI</li>
<li>Someone has most likely solved the problem you're trying to solve</li>
<li>Spend 5 minutes doing a Google research before starting to solve a new problem, e.g. stackoverflow is a good place.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learn how to debug efficiently</h4>
<ul>
<li>You won't write completely stable code anyway - impossible looking conditions will occur.</li>
<li>When something is not working as expected, there are plenty of tools out there to help you figure out what's going on.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Test your code</h4>
<ul>
<li>No surprises (especially in production)</li>
<li>Make sure that everything works as expected</li>
<li>Make sure that old stuff works as expected after introducing new features (regression)</li>
<li>Tests give you confidence while refactoring</li>
<li>Good tests demonstrate the use cases of application, i.e. they also document the implementation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Write high quality code</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to read</li>
<li>Better maintainability</li>
<li>Better quality == less bugs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use continuous integration and deployment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the tests pass</li>
<li>CI is the place where it's possible to run also some time consuming tests which the impatient developers prefer to
  skip on their local machines</li>
<li>Make sure there's no linting errors</li>
<li>Ideally, the place to test against all target versions and platforms</li>
<li>Overall, CI is the last resort for automatically ensuring the quality</li>
<li>Manual deployments are time consuming and error-prone, CD is automated and deterministic</li>
<li>You want to automate as much as possible, human time is expensive</li>
<li>Minimize the time required for code reviews - what could be detected with automatic tools, should be detected by using
  those tools. Human time is expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>12 steps to readable and maintainable Python code</h3>
<ol>
<li>Declutter the repo with .gitignore</li>
<li>No passwords in the code: use configuration files or environment variables</li>
<li>Have a README.md[.rst]</li>
<li>If you use third-party libraries, have a requirements.txt/Pipfile/pyproject.toml</li>
<li>Format your code with black</li>
<li>Remove unused imports</li>
<li>Remove unused variables</li>
<li>Follow PEP-8 naming conventions</li>
</ol>

<li>Verify your code with a linters</li>
<li>Remove debugging print() / breakpoint()</li>

<h3>The 10 Most Common Mistakes That Python Developers Make</h3>
<ol>
<li>Misusing expressions as defaults in function parameters</li>
<li>Using class variables incorrectly (NB: list.mro() -&gt; [list], list.<strong>mro</strong> -&gt; (tuple))</li>
<li>Specifying parameters incorrectly for an exception block</li>
<li>Misunderstanding Python scope rules (LEGB rule)</li>
<li>Modifying a list while iterating over it</li>
<li>Confusing how Python binds variables in closures</li>
<li>Creating circular module dependencies</li>
<li>Name clashing with Python Standard Library modules</li>
<li>Failing to address differences between Python 2 and Python 3</li>

<p>While both methods appear to produce the same result, there is an extremely significant difference between them. Method
2 produces, as you would expect, an array of 3 elements, each of which is itself <em>an independent 4-element array</em>(2). In
method 1, however, the members of the array <em>all point to the same object</em>(1). This can lead to what is most likely
unanticipated and undesired behavior as shown below.</p>

<h5>Q: How to check that tuple A contains all elements of tuple B?</h5>
<p>You can use <code>set.issubset()</code> or <code>set.issuperset()</code> to check if every element in one tuple or list is in another.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>tuple1 = (1, 2)
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
set(tuple1).issubset(tuple2)  # True
set(tuple2).issuperset(tuple1)  # True
</code></pre>

<h5>Q: How to check if both tuples contain unique values?</h5>
<p>len(set(tup)) == len(some_tuple)
This creates a set of some_tuple and checks if it is the same length as the original some_tuple. The only case in which
they would have the same length is if all elements in tup were unique.</p>
<h5>Q: Mention the use of the <code>split()</code> function in Python?</h5>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>str splitted on whitespaces → list of str
"words with spaces".split() → ['words','with','spaces']
